Reproducibility: How R Markdown can help you (and others) organize your workflow and retrace your steps
R Markdown is a document type that can integrate many separate files into one "master" file that compiles them all to produce a report, homework assignment, web app, or thesis, among many other things. We'll get some hands-on experience with the R Markdown format, explore the different ways we can publish a document, and look at the thesisdown package as a Markdown-style template for the Reed senior thesis. Some applications of R Markdown to scientific reproducibility (natural and social sciences) will be discussed. Beginner friendly! You don't need to know R to use R markdown.



Pre-class: have R and RStudio (recommended, not required) downloaded, or log onto the server

What is a .RMD document?
<Display a file on the big screen>
- Created by RStudio
- Plain text file: you can create a regular text file and save with the .Rmd extension (or use the template)
- Mixes text, *code chunks* (any language), images, and formatting
- Similar to LaTeX in that this is a source file, which creates a finished product (HTML, PDF, Word)
- Compatible with LaTeX, HTML formatting, Markdown-style formatting
- Can even use other languages

RStudio comes with a .Rmd template.
<Open a .Rmd file, give it a name, leave it as HTML output>
<Note: this won't be what your output file looks like, it's just the instructions>

- YAML: contains "metadata" for the doc and universal formatting rules
- Title, date, author
- Output type (HTML, PDF, Word, ioslides/Beamer, GitHub doc)
- Table of contents
- Standard themes or custom CSS file for HTML formatting
- How to display tables, plots, and images

Text: Regular text! Uses markdown formatting
- ### for headers
- *italics*, **bold**
- $inline math$
- [name](web/file link)
* list
* list 2
  + sublist

1. Ordered list 1
2. Ordered list 2

Code: Both chunk style and inline
- Chunks have the ```{r} code here``` format
- Inline uses `r code here`

Knitting: turning your text file into output
- RStudio "Knit" button
- `rmarkdown::render("file")`
- By default, this will print and evaluate code chunks: any code will be printed, and any visible output will display

Why should I be using R Markdown?
- It's a good document format, even for just text output.
- Solves (some of) the problem of "well, it works on my computer!" (more on this soon)
- Follows the ethos of open-source/transparency/reproducibility in the R community (more on this soon)
- More formatting control than Word, but easier to learn than HTML or LaTeX
- Good for semi-casual publication (blogs, homework, final projects).
<I do my homework in RMD!>
- Plays well with version control (Git & GitHub)
