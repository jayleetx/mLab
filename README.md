# mLab

This is a repository of some of the work I've done for Reed College's mLab, a software help space for faculty members and (often) seniors writing their theses. All data has been anonymized and randomized, to mask the findings of people's actual research.

My current long-term project is [state population centers](/state_pop_centers), a Shiny app that will (eventually) produce state-specific maps of mean population center over time (similar to [this](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/cenpop2010/centerpop_mean2010.pdf)).

Most of the "problem-solving" work I do is in the [R Task Files](/R_task_files) folder, separated into different tasks.

The [Paideia 2018](/paideia2018) folder contains some slides and notes for two short classes on R topics that I taught this semester.

The [Reed R guide](reed_R_guide.Rmd) is a guide (in progress) to setting up, learning, and using R at Reed.
