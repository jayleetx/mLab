So, here's the problem and the data ...

.... researcher  is trying to get GC content out of her sequences, using the seqinr package. seqinr has some funkiness in terms of data formats, from my work with it...

Attached also == my solution. Which is janky and a bit manual, and also got her the numbers she needed by lab meeting.

How would you approach this?
