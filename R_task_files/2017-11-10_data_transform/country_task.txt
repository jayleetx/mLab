that data table is sideways

three tasks

in any order you deem smartest

should end up with data that is... (1) tidy (2) variable names that are currently in column 1 (3) variable names that are *consistent* a/c countries so one can merge the tables per country

(look at e.g. `simplified mexico` and `simplified argentina`)

variable names switch example: `americamarket_ar` should be `americamarket`
