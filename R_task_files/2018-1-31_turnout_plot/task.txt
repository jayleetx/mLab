I’ve attached the Excel file that I will have them import. And all I want them to be able to do is to draw two connected lines, one for one state (in my case, OR), and for the second state (WA).  And that’s it.

Just a very little introduction to graphics which is not covered in the book.

turnout <- read_excel("Pol311_Labs/pset2 master/data/1980-2014 November General Election.xlsx”)

turnout_or_wa <- subset(turnout, subset = (X1980_2014_November_General_Election$`ICPSR State Code`== 72 | X1980_2014_November_General_Election$`ICPSR State Code` == 73))

plot(turnout_or_wa$year, turnout_or_wa$`ICPSR State Code`)			# this is an ugly plot

….now … how can I get a plot with lines connected for OR and for WA separately?
