I like to use R for stuff to force myself to learn to do it.....

I'm trying to plot student grades and I want to give them back a plot that has their scores to compare to the overall class scores.

thus far my solution is to make two separate boxplots. But really I want one plot that has two sets of boxplots alternating for each criteria.

here is the code I'm currently using and the data is attached

I'm not averse to ggplot if that works better, I just don't know it well.

data<- read.csv(file="Wed_scores.csv", header = TRUE)
# par(mfrow=c(1,2))
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
boxplot(data[,2:5], main = "class", ylim = c(0,11), las = 2, col = "grey")
boxplot(data[which(data[,1]=="James/Leo"), 2:5], main = "group1" , ylim = c(0,11), las = 2)
